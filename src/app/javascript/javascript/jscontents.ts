            introduction: "In JavaScript, reference data types are an essential concept that every developer must understand to handle complex data structures effectively. Unlike primitive types, reference types are stored and manipulated by reference rather than value. This article dives into reference data types and their key characteristics.",

                'Equality for reference types is checked by reference, not by value. Two objects with identical data are not equal unless they reference the same memory location.',
                'When a reference type is passed to a function, the reference itself is passed, not a copy of the value. This means changes made inside the function affect the original data.'

        // Example of Reference Data Types
let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1; // Both obj1 and obj2 point to the same object

obj2.name = "Bob";
console.log(obj1.name); // Output: "Bob"

// Array example
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Function as a reference
function updateName(person) {
  person.name = "Charlie";

updateName(obj1);
console.log(obj1.name); // Output: "Charlie"

            conclusion: "Understanding reference data types is vital for working with complex structures in JavaScript. Knowing how they are stored, accessed, and manipulated allows developers to write more efficient and bug-free code. Mastering this concept unlocks the full potential of JavaScript for both small and large-scale applications."
